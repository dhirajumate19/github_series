**How GitHub Worked**?   \ 
The first two things you&#39;ll want to do are install git and create a free GitHub account.
In your account you can add email and manage preference of email. You can also customize your GitHub profile
Next,when creating a new project on your local machine using git, you&#39;ll first create a
new repository (repo). Then adding Files to that Repo and commit the changes. When
you commit changes you must select master branch or create new branch.         
**Cloning** 

when you create a repository on _GitHub_, it exists as a remote repository. You can
**clone** your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two
locations. When you&#39;re working with a repository on GitHub, you might want to have it on
your local machine to make it easier to work with and it allows us to use your favourite
editor, to add and remove files, or to fix Bug on it. You cannot fork a private repository to an
organization using GitHub Free. Deleting a fork will not delete the original repository.     

**Forking**  

A **fork** is a copy of a repository that you manage. Forks let you make changes to a
project without affecting the original repository. You can fetch updates from or submit
changes to the original repository with pull requests. You can fork any public repository to
your user account or any organization where you have repository creation permissions.

**Making Pull Request**    

You can edit file or changes in file successfully, now that you have changes in a branch
off of master. you can open a pull request. Pull Requests are the collaboration on GitHub.
When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone

review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests
show differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions
are shown in green and red colour on line.
As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even
before the code is finished.
You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It’s a great
way to learn the GitHub flow before working on larger projects.    

**Opening issues**  

Use **issues** to track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub. You can
collect user feedback, report software bugs, and organize tasks you would like to accomplish
with issues in a repository. Issues can act as more than just a place to report software bugs.
You can link a pull request to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically
close the issue when someone merges the pull request. To stay updated on the most recent
comments in an issue, you can watch an issue to receive notifications about the latest
comments and to quickly find links to recently updated issues you&#39;re subscribed to.
